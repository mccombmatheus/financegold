// CLIENT_ID is committed with its real value on purpose (same for
// SPREADSHEET_ID routing in js/tenants.js) — this app has no backend, so
// anything the browser needs is visible in the deployed JS to anyone who
// opens the live app regardless of what's in the git repo. The real access
// boundary is each spreadsheet's Google Drive sharing + the OAuth Client's
// "Authorized JavaScript origins", not secrecy of these IDs.
//
// SPREADSHEET_ID / SHEET_NAME are no longer fixed here — they're resolved per
// logged-in user from js/tenants.js (multi-company support) and written onto
// this object at sign-in, in js/app.js.
